### Motivation

    Successfully pass the KAJ.

### Progress:

##### Points to improve:

<ol>
<li>Global state management is not functioning properly as useContext is being used without adequate memoization. </li> 
<li>The styles appear disorganized due to rapid prototyping and frequent changes.</li>
</ol>

##### Solution:

<ol>
    <li>Implement memoization for components or utilize specialized global state management tools like React.</li>
    <li>Migrate CSS styles to ChakraUI components.</li>
</ol>


##### Functionality:

Tasks could be added with a form. You could track particular tasks time with a timer.

##### Start state:

<img src="./public/start.png" width="800px">

##### Add a task:

<video controls width="800"> 
    <source src="./public/addtask.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

#### Drag'n'Drop links to your tasks in order to keep them organized.

<video controls width="800"> 
    <source src="./public/draganddrop.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>
