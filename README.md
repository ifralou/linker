## Linker app

### Motivation
    Successfully pass the KAJ.
### Progress: 

##### Points to improve:
1) Global state management is not functioning properly as useContext is being used without adequate memoization.
2) The styles appear disorganized due to rapid prototyping and frequent changes.

##### Solution:
1) Implement memoization for components or utilize specialized global state management tools like React.
2) Migrate CSS styles to ChakraUI components.

##### Functionality:

##### Start state:

<img src="./public/start.png" width="800px">

##### Add task:
